  description: >
    Fix an issue in the ci/check_extensions_build_config.sh script. One of the
    grep commands was simply grepping for 'commit', which meant that any other
    line in the file that contained the same word would also show up in the
    grep, thereby messing up any string processing that followed. We fix this
    by making the grep a bit stricter, ie. ensuring that the line _starts_ with
    'commit' (barring any preceding whitespace for indentation purposes).
