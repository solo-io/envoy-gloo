  resolvesIssue: false
  description: >
    Adds lambda option to persist original request info that otherwise is lost.
    Defaults to false to avoid leaking potentially sensitive info.
    Similar to envoy's x-forwarded-for header and may be desirable to be false when 
    envoy is in a mesh deployment.
    Implemented here to allow for usage of original request path in access logs.
