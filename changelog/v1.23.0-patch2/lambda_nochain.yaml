  description: >
    AWS lambda sts chaining is a powerful tool that enables stronger and more durable 
    cross account and region usage. However this means that we need to mantain
    more connections and have a more intense overhead in trust relationships.
    Given this it turns out that it is valid for a given upstream to sometimes
    not want to actually chain roles. This will allow for fine grained decisions.
