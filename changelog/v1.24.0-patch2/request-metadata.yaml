  description: >
    Resolves a error when processing request transformations in the AWS lambda
    filter. Prior to this change, the AWS lambda filter would modify the :path
    and :method pseudo-headers before the request transformation was
    processed, resulting in the upstream receiving invalid values of these
    headers.
