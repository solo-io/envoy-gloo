  description: >
    Avoids use-after-free error caused by encoding filters adding data to buffer/body 
    and hitting buffer size limit. Envoy destroys filters after hitting buffer size limit, 
    but the encoding filters continue execution, causing the error. This checks to see if the 
    encoding filter has been destroyed before continuing execution.
