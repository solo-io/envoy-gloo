# disables automatic changelog increment on release (bot committing "helpful" next changelogs)
# since next release version is ambiguous with label and cannot be derived from semver changelog
# type and the current version alone.
relaxSemverValidation: true
# our envoy changelogs / releases have the format $UPSTREAM_ENVOY_VERSION_$PATCH_NUM
# where the patch number is the number of releases on top of that upstream envoy version.
# as such, all changelogs should have a suffix in allowedLabels.
requireLabel: true
# use patch suffix when building on top of upstream LTS envoy version.
# use rc / beta if building on top of unreleated upstream envoy (i.e. main) depending
# on how well tested / supported the upstream envoy commit is.
allowedLabels:
  - patch
  - rc
